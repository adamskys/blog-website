          A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
          these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.

          I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
          created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
          friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
          that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single
          stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a
          greater artist than now.

            of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner

          I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and,
          as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by
          me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks. The Big
          Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
          Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind
          Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial
          into the belt and made herself on the way.

          Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it
          is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind
